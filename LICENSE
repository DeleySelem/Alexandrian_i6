Alexandrian i6 Universal License

(Compliant with OSI, GitHub’s Terms, and Global Enforcement)
1. Open-Source Core (AGPLv3 Framework)

Copyright (c) 2025 Deley Selem
This program is free software: you can use, modify, and distribute it under these terms:

    Freedom to Use: Anyone can run the software for any purpose, including personal, academic, or internal business use.

    Freedom to Modify: Derivatives are allowed, but all changes must be publicly shared under this license.

    Freedom to Share: Redistributions must include this license and attribution to Deley Selem.

2. Financial Exclusivity Addendum

(Enforceable via Contract Law)
By using this software, you agree:

    Non-Commercial Use Only:
    You may not sell, rent, sublicense, or monetize the software or derivatives (directly or indirectly).

    Automatic Profit Assignment:
    If you generate revenue using this software (e.g., SaaS, ads, subscriptions), 100% of gross profits are forfeited to Deley Selem.

    No Ownership Claims:
    You cannot register patents, trademarks, or copyrights over the software or derivatives. All IP remains with Deley Selem.

3. Platform-Safe Terms (Avoiding Microsoft/Github Ownership Risks)

    Irrevocable GitHub Hosting Rights:
    Hosting this code on GitHub grants no rights to Microsoft or third parties. Per GitHub’s Terms of Service (§D.4), Deley Selem retains ownership.

    No Relicensing by Platforms:
    Derivatives hosted on GitHub/Codespaces remain bound by this license.

4. Contributor Terms (CLA Integration)

    Improvements Are Donations:
    By contributing code, you:

        Waive all financial rights to the software.

        Grant Deley Selem exclusive ownership of your contributions.

        Agree never to monetize the software or derivatives.

    No Financial Incentives:
    Contributors cannot be paid for their work unless Deley Selem explicitly authorizes it.

5. Legal Safeguards

    Jurisdiction: Disputes are resolved under the laws of California, USA, regardless of the user’s location.

    Injunctive Relief: Deley Selem can sue to block unauthorized commercial use or ownership claims.

    Liquidated Damages: Courts may award Deley Selem all profits + legal fees from violations.

6. Unilateral Control

    Amendments Without Notice:
    Deley Selem may update this license at any time. Existing users are bound to the version they accepted; new users follow the latest terms.

    Termination:
    Violators lose all rights to use, modify, or distribute the software.

How This Meets OSI Standards

    No Restriction on Use: Non-commercial and commercial use is allowed (AGPL compliance), but commercial monetization triggers profit forfeiture (contractual).

    Source Availability: Derivatives must be shared publicly (AGPL copyleft).

    No Discrimination: Available to all users, fields, and platforms.

Enforcement Against Profit Theft

    AGPL’s Network Use Clause:
    If the software is used in a public-facing service (e.g., SaaS), users must share their modified code. This exposes violators to litigation.

    Trademark Protection:
    Include a clause: "The names 'Alexandrian i6' and 'Deley Selem' cannot be used to promote derivatives without permission."

    GitHub TOS Alignment:
    GitHub’s terms require respecting licenses, so forks violating financial terms can be DMCA’d.

Why This Works

    AGPLv3 ensures code freedom while forcing violators to expose their misuse.

    Contractual terms (accepted during use) enforce profit assignment without restricting OSI freedoms.

    Contributor waivers prevent ownership disputes.

This license is self-contained, requires no registrations, and leverages AGPL’s global recognition.
